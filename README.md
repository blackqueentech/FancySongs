# Summary

Fancy Songs uses the iTunes API. It is built-in with a search query for songs by Denis Kenzo (one of my favorite DJs). The app asynchronously loads the results from that API into a stylized, searchable list with links to a details page about each song.

# Tools

Fancy Songs is built in SwiftUI. It does not use any outside libraries.

# Future

In the future, I would like to expand Fancy Songs to do the following:
* have users select the artist they would like to see songs for
* play a clip of the song on its details page
